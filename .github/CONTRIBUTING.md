Reporting Bugs
==============
- Make sure you're using the latest release.
- If possible, also check if the problem has already been fixed in git master.
- Attach a log file made by running gnome-mpv on the command line like this:
  `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all gnome-mpv`
- Don't report multiple unrelated/barely related bugs in one issue.
